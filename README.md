# ISAGOAT

Welcome to Isagoat! This was my first discord bot, intended for use on my personal server.

Isagoat is NOT permanently deployed.

## Development

This project was created using the discord.py API and selenium python libary. Slash commands were implemented using a command tree and discord interaction objects.

I inlcluded customized responses based on user input and a simulated search engine that fetched and delivered responses in real-time.

## Future Work
- Integrate cloud-based database
- Incoorperate long-term message/reponse storage for more interactive experiences
